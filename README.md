# Zoomable Periodic Table of Elements

This is my [10K Apart entry for 2016](https://a-k-apart.com/gallery/Zoomable-Periodic-Table). The latest version has 
improved keyboard accessibility and a few other fixes which, unfortunately, I didn't have time to get in before the 
competition deadline.

## Install and Run

```
npm install
npm start
```

To run the minified version:

```
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

Now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

You can also configure the port with a `PORT` environment variable.
